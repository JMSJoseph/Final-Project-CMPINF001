The data we collected each were measured by a certain submetric. Combining these submetrics gives us the result of our combined metric, the neighborhood that is the best based 
on its safety. 

The metrics: 
-Obesity rates
-Air Quality (based on PPM2.5 measurements)
-Property value

For our the air quality metric, we results from the Air Quality index supploied by Alleghany County's Health Department. The results are taken from air quality monitors that
measure each of the respective areas particualte matter. The concentration of the particulate matter correlates to the amount of risk resulting from breathing the air. This
fact relates directly to the overall metric, safety. The neighborhood with the best air quality would have the best rating within the submetric and in turn in the overall 
metric. 

When looking at the obesity metric, with results taken from the Alleghany County's Health Department as well, would also directly relate to the safety metric. Areas with 
higher obesity would indicate a lack of good general health. This would be resulting from a possible lack of sufficient nutritional options.
